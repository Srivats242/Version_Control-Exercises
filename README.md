Our Program asks the user for the major they're studying at Pitt and for how long they are going to study that specific major. 


# What the software does
Our Program asks the user for the major they're pursuing at Pitt and for how long they are planning to pursue that major at Pitt. After that, our program will ask the user how many credit classes they are planning to take as well as whether they are pursuing a double major, dual degree or minor. Based on the amount of credits the user is planning to take overall from his dual degree, double major or minor, our program will calculate in how many years the user will graduate.

# How to use it
The creators of the code will publicize the SSH link to the project. The user will enter a command on the terminal called git clone (Project's SSH link). The Project's SSH link is: (git@github.com:Srivats242/Version_Control-Exercises.git).  After they enter this command, they will have access to our project's README.md, LICENSE.md and CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md. The user can read over these documents to better understand how our programs works and how they can use it. They can make changes to our testfiles or code and next they have to enter a specific command on the terminal called nano to create a new text file. They have to type nano README.md to open the README.md file. After the user makes changes to the README.md or to certain files after typing git add. on the terminal, a test file is created and the user can make changes to that test file by typing anything he/she wants in it.


The user can type anything he wants in our code and run our code to see what it does specifically. The user can type git commit -m "my first commit" or anything else in the parantheses to show he made changes to the project on the command line terminal. The user can type "git push origin main" after all these changes to move the files that they have entered text into to their repository which is on github if they created a git hub account.


# Installation Documentation

The user should login to github.com and go to the Pull requests tab on top left that is under the profile name to create a pull request that updates the content in their repository to see their edits and changes to the creators' repository. The creators of the project will click "Merge Pull Request" to accept the edits or changes of the users. The user then should type git checkoutmain which switches from the edited readme branch to the original primary branch. Once the user does that you must merge your changes from the read me branch to the primary branch and to do that you would type git merge. The user can type "test" on the command line terminal that prints on the screen, `You're running foobar v2.3. The current directory is /home/foobar. The database is MySQL. If you're reading this, everything is running correctly.` This means the user has properly transferred the contents from the creator's repository to their own repository.

Our project is a Beerware license which means that users can use this license permissively or freely without worrying about any restrictions in their use of the license.

# Usage Documentation

Our project allows the user to freely link, distribute and modify our project and share it with other individuals without worrying about the implications of sharing our project with others. The user can sublicense our project if he would like to as well. The user is first supposed to enter what major he is pursuing when the following output is shown: What major are you pursuing: . After the user enters the major they are pursuing in college, they will encounter another question-  How long is your degree program? :. The user will then enter the number of years he will be studying that major at pitt. Then the user will be asked whether he is planning to pursue anything else along with his primary major as follows - "Are you planning to pursue a double major, dual degree or minor along with your primary major: ". Then the user will be asked how many credits is he planning to take with his secondary study plan as follows - "How many credits of classes of that specific secondary plan are you going to pursue? ". The user will enter the amount of credit of secondary classes he will be taking. The program will finally print the amount of time it will take him to graduate from Pitt as a final output of the program.
