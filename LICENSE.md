# License Usage

The user is allowed to use our software permissively as it is a Beerware license, which means that users don't need to worry about any restrictions or implications in their use of the software. We will explicitly tell the users that our software is a Beerware license in order for users to not worry abou how they can use the software. This gives the user(s) the opportunity to explore how our software works and learn various different things from our software. More people will be aware of how to calculate the amount of time it will take someone to graduate from college such as their friends or family from our software and they can build projects similar to ours to figure out when someone they know is graduating from college based on their plan for the next 4 years of college.

The maximum number of licensed users is determined by whatever size license was purchased by the license buyer. The license buyer can change who is designated as a licensed user, as long as the total doesnâ€™t exceed this license maximum.

Licensed users can use any font they would like for projects on behalf of a license buyer. Anyone who uses their own fonts when creating a project that is based of our software needs to be a licensed user.

Copy of my project's fonts can be distributed to anyone who is not a licensed user. Modified fonts can be shared with other licensed users. No technical support is available for modified text fonts. If any licensed buyer or any licensed user breaches the license, the license of this project will automatically terminate.
